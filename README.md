#SpeechToText
This will get an audio file, detect speech segments, send them to the Google Cloud Speech API and get a json file back with the content and the start time in seconds.

Functions for splitting the audio into speech segments were adapted from https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad (example.py)
